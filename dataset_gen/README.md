# Data Generation
To generate data first set the host and port of both server and client

    - The Client code is Client.java
    - After editing Client.java, compile it.
    - Run the Client code

For the server code i.e. dataset_gen.py

    - First of all adjust the file name
    - Set the host and port
    - Run the code

## Note:

Run the server code before running the Client
Close the Client code before closing Server

There are some exceptions and errors that have not been handled well now but the code can be used to generate data without much trouble.

## REMEMBER:

In case you close the server before the client the port will still remain active
Then change the ports in both the code and use normally
